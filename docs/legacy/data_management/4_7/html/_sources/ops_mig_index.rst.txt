Data Management Guide - Avere OS version 4.7

Avere OS's FlashMove^® and FlashMirror^® features help you move and
copy data between two filesystems - for example, from one core filer
to another, between NAS and cloud storage, or from one directory to
another on the same system.

FlashMove lets you migrate data from one storage system to another
without interrupting client access or having to change any client
settings.

FlashMirror provides ongoing data replication between two storage
systems for data protection.

Note: Additional licenses are required to enable the FlashMove and
  FlashMirror features. Read

  Appendix A: Adding or Removing Feature Licenses

   to learn how to purchase and install the licenses.

Create and monitor data migration jobs from the Data Management tab in
the Avere Control Panel.


The documents in this section explain the FlashMove and FlashMirror
features in depth. They give step-by-step instructions for creating
and monitoring Data Management jobs, and also include information
about troubleshooting or debugging jobs.

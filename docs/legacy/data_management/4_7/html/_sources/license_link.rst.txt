Appendix A: Adding or Removing Feature Licenses

Several Avere OS options require a separate license. Additional
licenses are required for these features:

FlashCloud

FlashMove

FlashMirror

After you purchase a license, you must send your license ID to Avere
Global Services, and they will provide you with a license key.

Note: vFXT nodes also require separate licenses, but Avere OS
  includes an automatic installation utility for vFXT licenses. You
  should not need to use the procedure described here on vFXT node
  licenses unless the automatic system encounters problems.

Adding a License

To obtain and install a license:

Navigate to the Settings > Cluster > Licenses page.


Contact Avere Global Services, and provide the Licensing ID listed at
the top of the Licenses page.

Enter the license key provided by Avere Global Services in the License
Key field.

Click the Submit button.

The new license and its associated features appear in the Licenses
area.

Removing a License

You can also use the Avere Control Panel to remove a license.

From the Settings > Cluster > Licenses page, select the Remove button
in the row of the license you want to remove.

A pop-up window appears asking if you are sure you want to remove the
license. Click OK to continue.

The license is removed from the list.

After removing a FlashMove or FlashMirror license, you will no longer
be able to create FlashMove or FlashMirror jobs. Previous jobs still
can be viewed from the Data Management tab.

Native Identity

Avere OS's native identity feature simplifies SMB configuration by
passing Windows security identifiers (SIDs) from a Windows client to
the core filer instead of translating the SID into a UNIX-style user
or group ID (UID/GID). You can use native identity with NAS core
filers or with cloud storage.

Native identity can be used in the following configurations where a
Windows client identifier doesn't have a mapping to a UNIX-style
identity:

For a NAS core filer:  The back-end core filer must have SMB enabled.
(You cannot use native identity with NAS core filers that do not
support SMB.)  The back-end filesystem security style must use SMB
ACLs.

For a cloud core filer:  The filesystem security style must be CIFS
ACLs.

The alternative to native identity is to provide mappings between SIDs
and UID/GIDs. These user mappings can be stored in an AD or LDAP
server.

Native identity can be enabled or disabled from the

VServer > CIFS

 settings page.

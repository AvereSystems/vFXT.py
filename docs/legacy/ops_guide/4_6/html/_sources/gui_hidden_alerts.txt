Administration > Hidden Alerts


You can view and manage hidden alerts on this page.

The table lists the cluster alerts that have been dismissed and
conditions that have been hidden.

Use this page to unhide conditions and to cancel auto-dismiss for
alerts.

Use the checkboxes in the table to select the type of condition or
alert, then click the Unhide/Stop Auto-Dismissing to cause these
status messages to reappear in the dashboard.

There is one row for each type of alert or condition; you cannot
select individual occurrences within that type. (Occurrences are
listed by timestamp in the right column of the table.)

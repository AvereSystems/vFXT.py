Selecting an Access Control Method for SMB

SMB (sometimes called CIFS) uses access control lists (ACLs) to
control access to files. The Avere cluster can communicate ACLs to SMB
clients in one of three ways, depending on the types of filesystems
used by the vserver's core filer:

NFSv3 – If the core filer supports only NFSv3, the Avere cluster
translates between POSIX mode bits and SMB/CIFS ACLs.  Core filers
that support only NFSv3 and use POSIX mode bits do not require any
special configuration.

SMB ACLs – If the core filer supports SMB natively, the Avere cluster
can pass SMB ACLs directly between the client and the core filer.  If
you are using a simple namespace (a legacy configuration; most
administrators use global namespace instead) the SMB share name on the
cluster must match the name of the matching share on the core filer.

Considerations for Selecting Access Control

When selecting an access control mechanism for a particular SMB share,
consider the following criteria:

Does the core filer support SMB natively (for instance, a Data ONTAP
qtree with the security style ntfs)?  If so, you must use SMB ACLs.

Does the core filer support only NFSv3? If so, use POSIX mode bits.

If you are using SMB ACLs, read

operation with the Avere cluster.

Erase and Reconfigure Page

The Erase and Reconfigure page appears if you click the Reconfigure
with modifications button from the

Administration > System Maintenance

 page.

Caution: Do not use the reconfigure controls without help from Avere
  Global Services. This  operation makes significant, irreversible
  changes to the cluster.


Caution: Modifying the configuration with these controls has the
  following effects:

  All secondary nodes are removed from the cluster. Only the primary
  node (listed at the bottom of the System Maintenance page) remains
  after the restart.

  Nodes might be renamed.

  All cached data is discarded. Client writes will be lost if they
  have not already been flushed to the core filers before this
  operation.

  HA and SMB settings for the cluster are discarded, even if you use
  the Reconfigure with current option.

  There is no way to retrieve the previous configuration or cache data
  after this operation.

Contact Avere Global Services to learn more about using these
controls.

Appendix D: Port Configuration

For full functionality, your cluster's FXT nodes should have access
through your system's firewall to the following ports.

NFS Ports

Allow inbound and outbound traffic on these ports.

      Protocol  Port  Service  TCP/UDP  111  RPCBIND  TCP/UDP  2049
NFS  TCP/UDP  4045  NLOCKMGR  TCP/UDP  4046  MOUNTD  TCP/UDP  4047
STATUS

SMB/CIFS Ports

For systems using SMB, open access to these ports.

Inbound traffic:

      Protocol  Port  Service  UDP  137  NETBIOS  UDP  138  NETBIOS
TCP  139  SMB  TCP  445  SMB

Outbound traffic:

      Protocol  Port  Service  TCP/UDP  53  DNS  TCP/UDP  88  Kerberos
UDP  123  NTP  UDP  137  NetBIOS  UDP  138  NetBIOS  TCP  139  SMB
TCP  445  SMB  TCP  389  LDAP  UDP  389  CLDAP  TCP  686  LDAPS

Additional Port Requirements

Your core filers might require access on additional ports. This
requirement varies depending on the type of storage used.

You can use the rcpinfo command to learn which ports are used by a
particular server. Issue this command from a client system that is not
firewalled:

   rpcinfo -p <server_IP_address>

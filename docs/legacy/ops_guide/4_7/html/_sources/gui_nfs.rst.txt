VServer > NFS


The NFS Settings page lets you enable or disable Kerberos
authentication for a particular vserver, and enable extended groups.

You must set up Kerberos for the cluster before you can enable it from
this page. Use the

Cluster > Kerberos

 page to configure Kerberos. (If Kerberos is not set up, there is a
link to the Kerberos configuration page in the Enable Kerberos panel.)
Read

Setting Up Kerberos Authentication

 to understand the settings required to configure Kerberos for various
types of cluster communication.

If your cluster includes more than one vserver, first choose which
vserver to configure by using the drop-down list at the top of the
page or in the side menu.

Kerberos

Check the box in the Enable Kerberos section to turn on Kerberos-based
authentication for the exports controlled by this vserver.

You also can enable Kerberos at the export level through a customized
export rule; read

Setting Up Kerberos Authentication

 to learn more.

Kerberos Service Key Management

The Kerberos Service Key Management panel allows you to upload a
keytab file for Kerberos authentication between this vserver and
clients.

This file is not the same as the keytab file for Kerberos
authentication between the cluster and core filers; that file is
uploaded on the

Cluster > Kerberos

 page. Read

Setting Up Kerberos Authentication

 to understand the different files and their purposes.

Extended Groups

Check the box in the Extended Groups section to enable extended group
support on this vserver. Extended Groups support allows users to be
members of more than 16 groups. (Standard NFS protocols limit the
number of groups per user to 16.)

Username download increases system overhead, so it is best to enable
this feature only if needed.

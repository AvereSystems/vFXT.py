Administration > Users


The Users settings page lets you configure individual usernames and
passwords for logging in to the Avere Control Panel.

Note: Only the system administrator account ("admin") can create or
  delete users on this page.

The

Login Services

 settings page also can be used to configure LDAP- or AD-managed users
and groups.

Two types of access are available for the Avere Control Panel:

Full Access allows users to configure cluster settings as well as to
monitor the cluster. (Full access users cannot create or remove user
accounts.)

Read-Only access allows users to monitor the cluster, but not to
update the cluster configuration.

The Users page is the only method to create accounts that can monitor
the cluster but cannot change settings.

User List

The top of the page shows a list of individual user accounts.


You can sort the user accounts by name or permissions.

Buttons in the Actions column can be used by the cluster administrator
to change accounts:

Remove - delete an account

Password - change the account password

Permission - change permissions between Full Access and Read Only

Note: You cannot change permissions for the default administrative
  user. There must always be a cluster administrator account defined
  in this page, even if you use a directory service to populate other
  user accounts.To change the password for the default administrative
  user, you must log in as that user. The default administrative user
  has the username "admin".

Adding Avere Control Panel Users

When the cluster administrative user loads the Users page, the Add New
User panel typically appears. If the panel does not appear, click the
button labeled Add New User to load it.


Enter the requested information and click Submit to create a new user
account.

Note: After you click the Submit button, you might be asked for the
  administrator password for the cluster.

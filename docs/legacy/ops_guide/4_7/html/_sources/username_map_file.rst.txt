Appendix E: SMB-UNIX Username Mapping

In some cases, you need to supply a mapping file that links Windows
usernames to their NFS (UNIX-style) counterparts.

A mapping file is only necessary if both of these conditions are true:

You are using SMB to access a junction that uses POSIX mode bit
security

One or more users who will access the junction with SMB have different
usernames on Windows-style systems and UNIX-style systems (for
example, user Jane Smith's Windows username is Jane Smith but her UNIX
username is smithj)

About Username Mapping

When creating a mapping, be aware of the following tips about how the
Avere cluster identifies users when using SMB to access a POSIX mode
bit junction:

The cluster vserver uses the Windows username when authenticating the
user.

The cluster vserver uses the NFS username when accessing data on the
core filer.

In other words, the user is

authenticated

 with the Windows identity but

authorized

 with the NFS identity. So file access is controlled with the NFS
username.

Mapping files are specified at the cluster level. Settings for all
affected vservers should be included in one file.

Creating a Username Map File

The username map file should be a plain text file. Store it in a
location where your cluster vservers can access it through a URI.

Format the username map as follows:

Each line maps one username in the format
UNIX_username=AD_DOMAIN\Windows_username where:  UNIX_username is the
user's NFS username.  AD_DOMAIN is the cluster's Active Directory
domain.  Windows_username is the userâ€™s Windows username. If the
Windows username includes spaces, enclose it in double quotation
marks.  Example:  smithj=HOME3\"Jane Smith"

A line that begins with a pound symbol (#) is treated as a comment.

Refer to the

example file

 below.

Adding the Map File to the Avere cluster

Specify the mapping file on the

Cluster > Directory Services

 settings page. The control for specifying the file does not appear in
the setup wizard, only in the configuration details page - read

The Directory Services Configuration Details Page

 for more information.

File Example

The following is an example of a username map file:

   # The next line maps the UNIX user timmy to the Windows user
   # "Timothy Primate" in the AD domain MYDOMAIN:
   timmy=MYDOMAIN\"Timothy Primate"
   #
   # The next lines map more UNIX usernames to Windows usernames
   # in the same AD domain:
   cgflynn=MYDOMAIN\"C. Gertrude Flynn"
   fletch=MYDOMAIN\"Lawrence Fletcher"
   jeremyj=MYDOMAIN\"Jeremy Johnson"
   perry=MYDOMAIN\"Perry Monotreme"
   vanessa=MYDOMAIN\"Vanessa Doofenshmirtz"

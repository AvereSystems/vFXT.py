Restoring Files from Snapshots

You can use a snapshot to restore changed or lost files. You must use
the command-line interface to restore files from a snapshot.

All snapshot files are read only.

To restore files from a snapshot:

Mount the vserver that is associated with the cloud core filer. For
example:  mount 203.0.113.123:/cloud/ /tmp/source/

Navigate to the mount point destination.  cd /tmp/source

Change to the .snapshot directory.  cd .snapshot

List the folders in the .snapshot directory and change to the
directory that corresponds to the snapshot that you want to use.
Manual snapshots are stored in a directory labeled with the snapshot
name; automatic snapshot directories are named with a combination of
the snapshot name and the date and time.

Locate the file or files that you want to restore and copy them from
the snapshot directory to a convenient location on the local machine.
cp myfile.txt /tmp/restored/myfile.txt

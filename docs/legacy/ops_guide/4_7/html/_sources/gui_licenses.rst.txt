Cluster > Licenses


The Licenses settings page shows licenses that are installed on your
system and gives options for adding or removing licenses.

Some Avere OS features, including FlashCloud, FlashMove, and
FlashMirror, require separate feature licenses. After purchasing a
license, send the license ID to Avere Global Services to receive the
license key that you will install on this screen.

The procedure is described in detail in

Appendix A: Adding or Removing Feature Licenses

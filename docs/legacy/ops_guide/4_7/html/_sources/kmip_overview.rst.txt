Configuring KMIP for an Avere cluster

Avere OS gives you the option to use server-based key management for
encrypting traffic to and from cloud core filers using the Key
Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).

KMIP allows you to use a separate server to store and transmit
encryption credentials. (Choosing and setting up a KMIP server is
beyond the scope of this document.)

These are the basic steps in enabling KMIP for a cluster:

Create or import X.509 certificates to support authentication between
the cluster and the KMIP server.  Use the Cluster > Certificates
settings page.

Define a KMIP server.  Use the Cluster > KMIP Servers page.

Specify the KMIP server as the encryption key store for a cloud core
filer.  When creating a cloud core filer, you can specify the server
at the end of the process; read Adding a New Core Filer - Cloud Core
Filer to see how.  For an existing cloud core filer, use the Core
Filer > Cloud Encryption Settings page.

Read the linked pages to learn more about the required settings for
KMIP.

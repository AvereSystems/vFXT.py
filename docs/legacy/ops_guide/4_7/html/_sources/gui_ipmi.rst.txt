Cluster > IPMI


This page lets you configure how IP addresses are assigned to the
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) cards in the cluster
nodes. IPMI is used for remote access to a node, and can be used to
troubleshoot malfunctioning FXT nodes.

Avere Systems recommends configuring IPMI on all cluster nodes so that
they can be accessed in the event of a node failure.

This page defines the cluster-wide IPMI configuration, which is
automatically applied to all existing cluster nodes as soon as the
configuration is saved. When a new node joins the cluster, it
automatically takes on these IPMI settings.

Choose from the following options:

No IPMI Configuration
   Does not change the IPMI setting. IPMI cards typically are
   configured to use DHCP when shipped from Avere. If choosing this
   setting, make sure that the card still has a valid configuration -
   if an IPMI card does not have an IP address it cannot be used for
   system recovery.

Static
   Assign static addresses to the IPMI cards in the cluster. When
   choosing this option, you must specify the following:

   IP address range - specify a contiguous address range by entering
   the first and last IP address in the range.

   Netmask

   Router address (in dot notation)

DHCP
   Use DHCP to assign the IPMI card's address.

The top of the page lists the nodes in the cluster. Clicking on a node
name loads the

Node Details

 page, which includes options for setting a custom IPMI configuration
for an individual node. Read

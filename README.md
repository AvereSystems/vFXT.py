# Avere vFXT

<img src="docs/images/avere_vfxt.png">

The Avere vFXT is an enterprise-scale clustered file system built for the cloud.

# Quickstart
  1. [Prerequisites](docs/prereqs.md)
  2. [Deploy](docs/jumpstart_deploy.md) - The fastest way to create a vFXT cluster.
  3. [Access the cluster](docs/access_cluster.md) - Access the Avere Control Panel from an SSH tunnel
  4. [Configure storage](docs/configure_storage.md) - Add a core filer, vserver, and junction
  
# How-to Guides
  * (Erin/Ron) Connecting clients - RRDNS and `mount`
  * [Moving data to the vFXT cluster](docs/getting_data_onto_vfxt.md) - Explains how to efficiently load data onto cluster storage by using parallel copy strategies
  * [Managing the cluster](docs/start_stop_vfxt-py.md) - How to stop, start, or decommission the cluster, and manage cluster nodes
  * [Cluster configuration and performance tuning](docs/config_tuning.md) - Additional cluster setup and performance optimizations
  * [Troubleshoot â€“ engage support](docs/engage_support.md)

# Concepts
* [Cloud bursting overview](/docs/cloud_bursting.md)
* [Cloud NAS overview](/docs/cloud_nas.md)

# Tutorials
  * [Measure vFXT performance with VDBench](docs/vdbench.md) - Deploys VDBench on an N-Node cluster to demonstrate the storage performance characteristics of the Avere vFXT cluster.
  * [Windows 10 Avere vFXT Mounted Workstation](docs/windows_10_avere_vfxt_mounted_workstation.md) - Creates a Windows Workstation that automatically mounts the vFXT, and installs various Azure Tools.
  * [Rendering using Azure Batch and the Avere vFXT](docs/maya_azure_batch_avere_vfxt_demo.md) - Demonstrates how to use the Autodesk Maya Renderer with Azure Batch and the Avere vFXT to generate a rendered movie.

# Resources
  * [vFXT Guides](http://library.averesystems.com/#vfxt) 
  * [fxt_cluster](http://library.averesystems.com/#fxt_cluster) - this guide is designed for clusters of physical hardware nodes, but some information in the document is relevant for vFXT clusters as well. In particular, these sections can be useful for vFXT cluster administrators: 
    * [Gui login](http://library.averesystems.com/create_cluster/4_8/html/initial_config.html#gui-login) - explains how to connect to the Avere Control Panel and log in. However, note that you must use a VPN or SSH tunnel to access the cluster nodes inside the|aws|VPC. Read node_ssl_tunnel for details.
    * [Config vServer](http://library.averesystems.com/create_cluster/4_8/html/config_vserver.html#config-vserver) - has information about creating a client-facing namespace
    * [Add Core Filer](http://library.averesystems.com/create_cluster/4_8/html/config_core_filer.html#add-core-filer) - documents how to add storage
    * [Config Support](http://library.averesystems.com/create_cluster/4_8/html/config_support.html#config-support) - explains how to customize support settings and remote monitoring. 
    * [Cluster Configuration Guide](http://library.averesystems.com/#operations) - is a complete reference of settings and options for an Avere cluster. A vFXT cluster uses a subset of these options, but many of the same configuration pages apply. 
    * [Dashboard guide](http://library.averesystems.com/#operations) - explains how to use the cluster monitoring features of the Avere Control Panel.

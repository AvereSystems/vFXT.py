# Hammerspace Anvil Run Once Configuration

This module is a run once configuration for a Hammerspace Anvil Standalone or High Availability Node configuration.  See the [Hammerspace File](../../../examples/hammerspace) example for more details.  Once this has been run on Anvil, it can never be run again, in accordance with a custom script extension.

In a High Availability Node configuration, only run this one a single node.

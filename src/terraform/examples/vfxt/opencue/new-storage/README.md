# Deploy Network, vFXT, OpenCue, and OpenCue client nodes

This example deploys a complete environment with OpenCue, render nodes, vFXT, and all the networking required to render the Moana Island Scene. This example creates an new empty Azure blob storage account to store the data accessed by the vFXT deployment.

## Deployment Instructions

1. browse to https://shell.azure.com

2. Specify your subscription by running this command with your subscription ID:  ```az account set --subscription YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID```.  You will need to run this every time after restarting your shell, otherwise it may default you to the wrong subscription, and you will see an error similar to `azurerm_public_ip.vm is empty tuple`.

3. double check your Avere vFXT prerequisites, including running `az vm image accept-terms --urn microsoft-avere:vfxt:avere-vfxt-controller:latest`: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/avere-vfxt/avere-vfxt-prereqs

4. If not already installed, run the following commands to install the Avere vFXT provider for Azure:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins
# install the vfxt released binary from https://github.com/Azure/Avere
wget -O ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform-provider-avere https://github.com/Azure/Avere/releases/download/tfprovider_v0.9.0/terraform-provider-avere
chmod 755 ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform-provider-avere
```


5. get the terraform examples
```bash
mkdir tf
cd tf
git init
git remote add origin -f https://github.com/Azure/Avere.git
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "src/terraform/*" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin master
```

6. `cd src/terraform/examples/vfxt/opencue/new-storage`

7. `code main.tf` to edit the local variables section at the top of the file, to customize to your preferences.  If you are using an [ssk key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys), ensure that ~/.ssh/id_rsa is populated.

8. execute `terraform init` in the directory of `main.tf`.

9. execute `terraform apply -auto-approve` to build the vfxt cluster

When you are done using the cluster, you can destroy it by running `terraform destroy -auto-approve` or just delete the three resource groups created.

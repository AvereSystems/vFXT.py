# OpenCue with HPC Cache and VMSS Render Nodes

The examples in this folder deploy OpenCue Server on Azure and a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) with OpenCue agents (RQD) to pick up jobs. The [pre-populated storage example](pre-existing-azure-blob) uses the [Disney Moana Island Scene](https://www.disneyanimation.com/resources/moana-island-scene/) in a pre-populated Azure blob storage account to render the scene. The [new storage example](new-storage) requires that you download the scene yourself, or use a different scene to render.
